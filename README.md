# Synaplan - AI Communication Management Platform

Synaplan is an open-source communication management platform that enables seamless interaction with various AI services through multiple channels. Built with modern PHP and leveraging vector search capabilities, it provides a robust foundation for AI-powered communication and tracking.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **PHP 8.3+** with the following extensions:
  - `curl`, `json`, `mysqli` (required)
  - `memcached` (recommended for session management)
  - `bcmath`, `bz2`, `gd`, `http`, `imagick` (recommended)
- **MariaDB 11.7+** (required for vector search capabilities)
- **Composer** (for PHP dependencies)
- **npm (of Node.js)** (for frontend dependencies)
- **Web server** (Apache/Nginx)
- **Linux System Tools** (required for audio processing and file operations):
  - `ffmpeg` (for audio/video file processing)
  - `curl` (for external API communications)
  - `wget` (for downloading models and files)

### Step-by-Step Installation

After installation, synaplan sits in "web/", the "www/" directory is our official website.

#### 1. Download and Extract
```bash
# Clone or download the repository
git clone https://github.com/orgaralf/synaplan.com.git
cd synaplan
```

#### 2. Database Setup
```sql
-- Create database and user
CREATE DATABASE synaplan;
CREATE USER 'synaplan'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'synaplan';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON synaplan.* TO 'synaplan'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### 3. Load Database Schema
Load all SQL files from the `db-loadfiles/` directory into your MariaDB database. The files can be loaded in any order:

```bash
# Option 1: Using mariadb command line
mariadb -u synaplan -p synaplan < db-loadfiles/*.sql

# Option 2: Using phpMyAdmin or your preferred database tool
# Import each .sql file from the db-loadfiles/ directory
```

**Note:** This will create the default user account for the web frontend:
- **Username:** synaplan@synaplan.com
- **Password:** synaplan

#### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install PHP dependencies
cd web/
COMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT=1600 composer install

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

#### 5. Configure Web Server
Point your web server's document root to the `web/` directory.

Note the security hint about the ".env" file. Disallow that - how is described below.

**Apache Example:**
```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName your-domain.com
    DocumentRoot /path/to/synaplan/web
    
    <Directory /path/to/synaplan/web>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

**Nginx Example:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    root /path/to/synaplan/web;
    index index.php;
    
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }
    
    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

#### 6. Set File Permissions
```bash
# Create upload directory and set permissions
mkdir -p web/up/
chmod 755 web/up/
chown www-data:www-data web/up/  # Adjust user/group as needed
```

#### 7. Configure Environment
Create a `.env` file in the `web/` directory with your API keys:

```env
# AI Service API Keys (configure at least one)
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434  # If using local Ollama

# Database Configuration (if different from defaults)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=synaplan
DB_USER=synaplan
DB_PASS=synaplan

# Other Configuration
DEBUG=false
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING:** The `.env` file contains sensitive information and **MUST NOT** be accessible via web requests. Ensure your web server configuration blocks access to `.env` files:

**Apache (.htaccess):**
```apache
<Files ".env">
    Require all denied
</Files>
```

**Nginx:**
```nginx
location ~ /\.env {
    deny all;
    return 404;
}
```

**Recommended AI Service:** We recommend [Groq.com](https://groq.com) as a cost-effective, super-fast AI service for production use.

#### 8. Update Configuration Paths
If you're not installing in `/wwwroot/synaplan.com/web/`, update the paths in `web/inc/_confsys.php`:

```php
// Update these values to match your installation path
$devUrl = "http://localhost/your-path/web/";
$liveUrl = "https://your-domain.com/";
```

#### 9. Verify Installation
1. Point your browser to your installation URL
2. You should see a login page
3. Login with the default credentials:
   - **Username:** synaplan@synaplan.com
   - **Password:** synaplan

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Vector search not working:** Ensure MariaDB 11.7+ is installed
- **Upload errors:** Check `web/up/` directory permissions
- **AI services not responding:** Verify API keys in `.env` file
- **Database connection errors:** Check database credentials and MariaDB service

**For Local Development:**
- If using Ollama for local AI processing, ensure you have a fast GPU
- The sorting prompt requires local processing capabilities

### Next Steps

1. Change the default password
2. Configure your preferred AI services
3. Set up communication channels (WhatsApp, Gmail, etc.)
4. Customize the web widget for your needs
