We need to expand the widget functionality in @widget.php and the connected files. 
The configuration is done in @c_webwidget.php and the result shall be a second way of integrating the widget. 

That way shall be named "inline-box" and works like this:
Instead of a floating button, an input field with a larger font can be integrated inline into a web page 
on another domain. Like the button, the integration shall be via Javascript. 
The inline input field shall be placeable for external customers on their web pages and 
when a web user clicks the input field, an overlay div, that covers almost the whole page 
(like the popup of the current button) shall appear. The styling of the input box should be 
configurable for our clients on the @c_webwidget.php page and they should able to clearly distinguish 
the two ways of integration. 

Please create the configuration for the inline-box first. It should be a compact input and button, 
in a way that pays attention to the "anonymous" settings we currently have. The client shall later be 
able to integrate it with <script src="https://app.synaplan.com/widget.php?....> like the button now, 
just with different parameters. 

Do only the config now, the rest later.
