# CI overrides for docker-compose.test.yml
# This file configures the setup for CI by:
#   1. Using a pre-built Docker image (via APP_IMAGE env var)
#   2. Removing volume mounts: no backend/plugins mounts (baked into image)
#   3. whatsapp-stub: expose 3999 so Playwright (on host) can reach stub for integration tests; keep container_name
#
# app_test reaches the stub at http://whatsapp-stub:3999 via backend/.env.test (WHATSAPP_GRAPH_API_BASE_URL).
#
# Usage in CI:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml -f docker-compose.test.ci.yml up

services:
  app_test:
    # Use pre-built image from CI (e.g., synaplan-test:ci)
    image: ${APP_IMAGE:-}
 
    volumes: !reset []

  whatsapp-stub:
    ports: ["3999:3999"]
    container_name: synaplan-whatsapp-stub
