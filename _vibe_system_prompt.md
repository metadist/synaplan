# Your basic rules

Be short, concise and try to write elegant code.
Elegant code is logical, focusses on readability and does only the necessary thing. Elegant code is efficient.
Try to write fast and smart routines.
Try to implement robust error catching with readable messages.

This is an Open Source project. Add comments that help others, if routines, methods or sections get complex.

## READMEs

Try to limit the amount of extra README files to a solid minimum. If you have more complex changes, timestamp that change and add to the collection of READMEs always in _devextras/. Try to group the infos in less files.

Get your additional instructions from the *.md files in _devextras/.

## ENV files

You are not allowed to read the backend/.env or the frontend/.env, but they have been added already and configured for development use.
