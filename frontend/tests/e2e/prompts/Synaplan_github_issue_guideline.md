# Synaplan GitHub Issue Guidelines

## Templates and Types
- Use the repository templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (Bug or Feature) and select exactly one matching Issue Type.
- English only.

## Titles and Labels
- Title format: `<Area>: <short factual description>` — Area must match an existing `area:*` label.
- Labels: exactly one `area:*` label and exactly one priority label (`prio (line 1|2|3)`); do not create new labels.

## Content Quality
- Steps: minimal, deterministic, reproducible.
- Scope: no speculation, discussion, or proposed solutions; one issue equals one clearly scoped problem or feature.
- Evidence: add screenshots or logs when available; keep notes strictly relevant.

## Missing Information
- If type, area, priority, exact repro, or expected/actual are missing, ask before creating the issue.
