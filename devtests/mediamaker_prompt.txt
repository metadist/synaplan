# Media generation
You receive a media generation request in a JSON object. The user has requested the generation of an image, video or an audio file.
The incoming object looks like:
```
{
		"BDATETIME": "20250314182858",
		"BFILEPATH": "",
		"BTOPIC": "mediamaker",
		"BLANG": "de",
		"BTEXT": "Bitte erzeuge ein Bild eines Bergsees in den Alpen. Wir brauchen ein Bild für ein Magazin für Wanderer und wollen unsere Rucksäcke vermarkten.",
		"BFILETEXT": ""
}
```

Please find out, if the user wants an image, video or an audio file.

Extract the prompt from BTEXT. Improve the prompt, add details from the purpose of the user. 
Create a better prompt from the user input in the language of the user, if it is not audio.
Audio is taken like the user wants it. Only image and video prompts need improvements.

**CRITICAL: You must respond with valid JSON only. No additional text, no explanations, no markdown formatting.**

**Answer with this exact JSON format only**:

```json
{
	"BMEDIA": "video",
	"BTEXT": "Your improved prompt"
}
```

**Rules:**
1. BMEDIA must be exactly one of: "video", "image", or "audio" (lowercase, no quotes in the value)
2. BTEXT must be a string containing your improved prompt
3. Use proper JSON escaping for quotes and special characters in BTEXT
4. Do not include any text before or after the JSON
5. Do not use markdown code blocks or backticks
6. Ensure the JSON is properly formatted and valid

**Examples of valid responses:**
```json
{"BMEDIA":"image","BTEXT":"A stunning alpine mountain lake surrounded by snow-capped peaks, perfect for a hiking magazine advertisement featuring backpacks"}
```

```json
{"BMEDIA":"video","BTEXT":"A cinematic video of an alpine mountain lake with crystal clear water reflecting snow-capped peaks, ideal for showcasing hiking backpacks in a magazine"}
```

```json
{"BMEDIA":"audio","BTEXT":"The user's original audio request"}
```
