This bypasses Symfony's security system and creates technical debt.\n\n### Current Issues:\n\n1. **No proper Symfony OAuth bundle**: Not using `knpuniversity/oauth2-client-bundle` or Symfony's built-in OAuth support\n2. **Manual OAuth flow**: `KeycloakAuthController.php` manually implements OAuth2 with raw `HttpClientInterface` calls\n3. **Security bypass**: OAuth is treated as \"just another way to get user info\", then app issues its own tokens (lines 179-181 in KeycloakAuthController)\n4. **No OAuth authenticator**: `security.yaml` shows custom authenticators for cookies/tokens/API keys, but no proper `OAuthAuthenticator`\n5. **Duplicated logic**: Similar patterns would need to be duplicated for each OAuth provider (Google, GitHub, etc.)\n\n### Current Architecture:\n\n**backend/src/Controller/KeycloakAuthController.php:**\n- Lines 58, 130: Manually constructs redirect URIs\n- Lines 125-133: Manual token exchange via HTTP POST\n- Lines 145-149: Manual userinfo fetch\n- Lines 179-181: Issues separate app tokens instead of using OAuth tokens\n\n**backend/config/packages/security.yaml:**\n- Lines 22-25: Custom authenticators, but no OAuth integration\n- Lines 62-63: OAuth routes marked as PUBLIC_ACCESS (security handled manually)\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nModernize to use Symfony's proper OAuth/OIDC integration:\n\n### Option 1: KnpU OAuth2 Bundle (Recommended)\n```bash\ncomposer require knpuniversity/oauth2-client-bundle\ncomposer require league/oauth2-client\n```\n\nBenefits:\n- Well-maintained, widely used\n- Supports multiple OAuth providers out of the box\n- Integrates with Symfony Security\n- Handles token refresh automatically\n\n### Option 2: Symfony 6.4+ Built-in OAuth\nSymfony 6.4+ has built-in OAuth authenticators, but would require checking compatibility with Symfony 7.3.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Install dependencies:**\n   ```bash\n   composer require knpuniversity/oauth2-client-bundle\n   ```\n\n2. **Create OAuth Authenticator:**\n   ```php\n   // src/Security/OAuthAuthenticator.php\n   class OAuthAuthenticator extends AbstractAuthenticator\n   {\n       // Proper integration with Symfony Security\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Update security.yaml:**\n   ```yaml\n   security:\n       firewalls:\n           api:\n               custom_authenticators:\n                   -

Remove manual HTTP requests\n   - Let Symfony handle token exchange and refresh\n\n5. **Configuration:**\n   ```yaml\n   # config/packages/knpu_oauth2_client.yaml\n   knpu_oauth2_client:\n       clients:\n           keycloak:\n               type: generic\n               provider_class: Stevenmaguire\\OAuth2\\Client\\Provider\\Keycloak\n               client_id: '%env(OIDC_CLIENT_ID)%'\n               client_secret: '%env(OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET)%'\n               redirect_route: auth_keycloak_callback\n               redirect_params: {}\n   ```\n\n## Benefits\n\n- ✅ **Follows Symfony best practices**\n- ✅ **More maintainable**: Standard OAuth patterns\n- ✅ **More secure**: Leverages Symfony's security system\n- ✅ **Token refresh**: Automatic handling\n- ✅ **Multi-provider**: Easy to add GitHub, Google, etc.\n- ✅ **Less code**: Remove ~200 lines of manual OAuth logic\n- ✅ **Better testing**: Can use Symfony's security test helpers\n\n## Files to Update\n\n- `backend/src/Controller/KeycloakAuthController.php` -
